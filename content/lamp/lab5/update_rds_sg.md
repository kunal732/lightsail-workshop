The final step in configuring the new Amazon EC2 intstance to access the Amazon RDS database is to add the instance security group to the RDS security group. This process is very similar to what you did earlier when you added the Amazon Lightysail IP address range to the RDS security group. 

* If you are not still there, go back to the details page for you Amazon EC2 instance and ensure you new instance is selected. 

* Scroll down to the bottom part of the screen where the instance details are listed.

* Click on the security group name
