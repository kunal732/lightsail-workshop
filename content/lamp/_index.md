This workshop consists of four hands-on labs that take you from deploying a two-tier LAMP stack application in a single Lightsail instance to having a fully fault tolerant and scalable version of that same application. 

Specifically, the four labs cover:

* Creating the infrastructure you will use in the subsequent labs

* Deploying a two-tier LAMP stack application as a monolith in a single Lightsail instance

* Rearchitecting the application by separating the front-end from the database

* Scaling and load balancing the web front-end.
